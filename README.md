dutch->german learning program.

# How to install
1. Download the .zip file and exctract it where you want to install the program.
2. (optional) create a shortcut to the .exe file to make running it easier.

# Adding lists
1. Create a new .json file in the "Lists" folder.
2. Structure it like this:
    {
"language":"THE LANGUAGE TO TRANSLATE TO",
"WORD 1 IN LANGUAGE A":"WORD 1 IN LANGUAGE B",
"WORD 2 IN LANGUAGE A":"WORD 2 IN LANGUAGE B",
etc
     }
3. Make sure to remove the comma from the final word pair.

(there is an example file in the lists folder already that you can use as a template.)

Your list should now be automatically detected by the program.
